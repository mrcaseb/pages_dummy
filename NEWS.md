# nflfastR 2.0.5

* Fix yet another bug caused by NFL providing plays out of order
* Fix bugs related to penalties on PATs and kickoffs
* Fix bugs related to NFL providing wrong scoring team on defensive touchdowns in older games involving the Jaguars
* Fix some minor issues related to wrong `first_down_rush` and `return_touchdown`
* Improved error handling of `fast_scraper()` for not yet played games
* Improved variable documentation and prepared for new website
* Improved performance for dplyr v1.0.0

# nflfastR 2.0.4

* Fix another bug with out of order plays
* Fix bug affecting cumulative totals for WPA, air_WPA and yac_WPA 
* Fix bug affecting cumulative totals for air_EPA and yac_EPA

# nflfastR 2.0.3

* Fix for NFL providing plays out of order
* Fix for series not incrementing following defensive TD

# nflfastR 2.0.2

* Fixed a bug in the series and series success calculations caused by timeouts
following a possession change
* Fixed win probability on PATs

# nflfastR 2.0.1

* Added minimum version requirement on `xgboost` (>= 1.1) as the recent `xgboost` update 
caused a breaking change leading to failure in adding model results to data

# nflfastR 2.0.0

### Models
* Added new models for Expected Points, Win Probability and Completion Probability 
and removed `nflscrapR` dependency. This is a **major** change as we are stepping away 
from the well established `nflscrapR` models. But we believe it is a good step forward.
See `data-raw/MODEL-README.md` for detailed model information.

* Added internal functions for `EPA` and `WPA` to `helper_add_ep_wp.R`.

* Added new function `calculate_expected_points()` usable for the enduser.

### Functions
* Completely overhauled `fast_scraper()` to make it work with the NFL's new server 
backend. The option `source` is still available but will be deprecated since there
is only one source now. There are some changes in the output as well (please see below).

* `fast_scraper()` now adds game data to the play by play data set courtesy of Lee Sharpe. 
Game data include:
away_score, home_score, location, result, total, spread_line, total_line, div_game, 
roof, surface, temp, wind, home_coach, away_coach, stadium, stadium_id, gameday

* `fastcraper_schedules()` now incorporates Lee Sharpe's `games.rds`.

* The functions `fast_scraper_clips()` and `fast_scraper_roster()` are deactivated 
due to the missing data source. They might be reactivated or completely dropped 
in future versions.

* The function `fix_fumbles()` has been renamed to `add_qb_epa()` as the new name
much better describes what the function is actually doing.

### Miscellaneous

* Added progress information using the `progressr`package and removed the 
`furrr` progress bars.

* `clean_pbp()` now adds the column `Ã¬d` which is the id of the player in the column `name`. 
Because we have to piece together different data to cover the full span of years,
**player IDs are not consistent between the early (1999-2010) and recent (2011 onward)
periods**.

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Fixed several bugs inhereted from `nflscrapR`, including one where EPA was missing 
when a play was followed by two timeouts (for example, a two-minute warning followed by a timeout),
and another where `play_type` was incorrect on plays with declined penalties.

* Fixed a bug, where `receiver_player_name` and `receiver` didn't name the correct
players on plays with lateral passes.

### Play-by-Play Output
The output has changed a little bit.
