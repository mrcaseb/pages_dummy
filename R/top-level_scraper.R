#' Get NFL Play by Play Data
#'
#' @param game_ids Vector of character ids (see details for further information)
#' @param source Character - must now be \code{nfl} or unspecified (see details for further information)
#' @param pp Logical - either \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} (see details for further information)
#' @details To load valid game_ids please use the package function \code{\link{fast_scraper_schedules}}.
#'
#' The \code{source} parameter controls from which source the data is being
#' scraped. The old parameters \code{rs} as well as \code{gc}
#' are not valid anymore. Please use \code{nfl} or leave unspecified.
#' The \code{pp} parameter controls if the scraper should use parallel processing.
#' Please note that the initiating process takes a few seconds which means it
#' may be better to set \code{pp = FALSE} if you are scraping just a few games.
